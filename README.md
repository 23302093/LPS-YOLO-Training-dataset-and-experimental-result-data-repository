# SSE-YOLO-Training-dataset-and-experimental-result-data-repository
This library is used to store the training and validation dataset used in the SSE-YOLO model. In order to ensure the authenticity of our experimental data, we will publicly display the experimental results of our model here.

It is worth noting that the result.png in each folder comes in two forms: black with white text and black with red text. This is because I used a computer and server for parallel testing to improve experimental efficiency. To ensure rigor, the basic hardware parameters of the two are consistent.
