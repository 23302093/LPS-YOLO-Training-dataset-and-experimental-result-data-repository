# LPS-YOLO-Training-dataset-and-experimental-result-data-repository
This library is used to store the training and validation dataset used in the SSE-YOLO model. In order to ensure the authenticity of our experimental data, we will publicly display the experimental results of our model here.

## Repository Structure

### Experimental Result Data
#### --Test
#### --Ablation
#### --Train
#### --Val


It is worth noting that the result.png in each folder comes in two forms: black with white text and black with red text. This is because I used a computer and server for parallel testing to improve experimental efficiency. To ensure rigor, the basic hardware parameters of the two are consistent.


Meanwhile, SSE-YOLO and ELS-YOLO in the screenshots of the experimental results are the names we gave to the model at the beginning, and we finally named it LPS-YOLO in order to more see accurately characterize our method.
